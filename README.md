# Solitaire_Game

Project Start Date: 1/12/21

Project End Date:   1/21/21


This is a somewhat basic game of Solitaire that is fully playable within the terminal window. It uses custom Card and Deck classes as the foundations, and the driver.cpp file which contains the functionality of the game itself.

To compile the code: g++ Card.cpp Deck.cpp driver.cpp -o Solitaire

To launch the game, I recommend NOT running the executable from the terminal. Sometimes, the sizing of the game board is altered when playing this way. Instead, I recommend double-clicking on the executable itself after compiling the code.
