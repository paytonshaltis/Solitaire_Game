# Solitaire_Game

Project Start Date: 1/12/21

Project End Date:   ongoing


This is a somewhat basic game of Solitaire that is fully playable within the terminal window. It uses custom Card and Deck classes as the foundations, and the driver.cpp file which contains the functionality of the game itself.
